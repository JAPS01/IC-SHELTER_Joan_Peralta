The GaZMOD44 is a refrigeration air quality sensor from Renesas and, based on the ZMOD4450 IC, it is designed to measure gases that are normally emitted during the ripening and spoiling of food. The sensor measures ethylene, amines, and volatile sulfur compounds and reports the data via I2C.

This sensor is compatible with 3.3v and 5v voltages.
